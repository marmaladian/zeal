# zeal
A little rogue/UltimaIV-like.

# to do
- change input handling so it is 'injected' into the actice UI section, rather than the player object doing the input reading.
- add 'add item at', 'remove item at' etc. methods to world
- tile generator (fg/bg colour for sprites)
# notes

Game objects
- World
  - Map
    - Actors (monsters, players)
    - Layer
      - Block (tile/terrain)
      - Item
      - Feature?
      - Decal?

UI objects
- UIMap
- UITileset

# ideas
- heat mechanic, the world is hot and you need to stay cool... running is exhausting, you can't cross open plains in day
- dilemma mechanics: e.g. your pack is getting scorched (flame or somehting) but you get a reaction to save them... pick one scroll to save/be destroyed.
- it's our alabaster majesty
